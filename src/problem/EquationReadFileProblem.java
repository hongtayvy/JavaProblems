     * We are going to build on the original equation problem we have. The big part of this we know

     * handle more variations of this. This first iteration, we are going to focus on what happens
     * to the data we read in from "src/data/equations.txt". Now I have already gone and written that part of the code
     * since it's not what you're currently focusing on.
     *
     * We are going to read the whole "src/data/equations.txt". We are going to run into the following:
     *  - Limits to substring() and indexOf()
     *  - How do we make sure that a line from equation is a valid set of data
     *
     * For now, we are going to handle the reading from "src/data/equations.txt":
     *  - We want to construct the data for the problem. What this means is that we want to take the text in from "src/data/equations.txt"
     *    and we want to standardize how the data is formatted for codeâ€™s sake at least. This means we are going to use the constructData
     *    method to standardize data we read in.
