     * We are going to build research skills along with some good String methods that you should know.
     * The problem is that we are going to take a full name and split it into two pieces firstName and lastName.
     * Once you've split it, we'll just reprint out the name, and you should be able to get the same output.
     *
     * Problem Breakdown:
     *  - Victor Yang will be store in a String variable called fullName.
     *  - You will then have two more String variables called firstName and lastName.
     *  - In firstName should be Victor
     *  - In lastName should be Yang
     *
     * ALSO: NO USER INPUT IS NEED. FEEL FREE TO ASSIGN FULLNAME WITH A NAME OF YOUR CHOOSING.
     *
     * Now useful String methods to take note of:
     *  - indexOf('c') where c is the character you are looking for
     *  - substring(n) where n is the position in the string to where you want that substring.
     *      - Example:
     *              String helloWorld = "Hello World";
     *              int indexOfHello = helloWorld.indexOf("o");
     *              String hello = helloWorld.substring(indexOfHello + 1); This will create a new string from the H to the first o which will get you "Hello"
     *              System.out.println(hello);
