     * We are going to build on what we know so far. This problem will be taking in an equation.
     * From here, we will decipher what the equation is trying to do, and we will solve the equation.
     * The following requirements:
     *  1. Be able to split the string into 4 smaller strings. You must split the strings via indexOfs and substrings methods only.
     *  Also feel free to rename variables, but you should make sure that the names make sense.
     *      1a. You will have leftHandOfOperation
     *          - This will hold the value left of the operation.
     *      1b. You will have operation
     *          - This will hold the value of what operation we are preforming.
     *      1c. You will have rightHandOfOperation
     *          - This will hold the value right of the operation.
     *      1d. You will have proposedAnswer
     *          - This will hold their suspected answer
     *  2. Once you have the values split up, you will preform the equation they proposed.
     *  3. Once you have the answer, you will compare the answer to their answer and see if it's correct.
     *      3a. If the problem is correct, you will print out the message that the equation is correct.
     *      3b. If the problem is incorrect, you will let them know that their equation is incorrect, and
     *          you will print show them the proper solution to their proposed equation.
     * For example:
     * Equation: 1 + 2 = 4
     *
     * leftHandOfOperation = 1
     * operation = +
     * rightHandOfOperation = 2
     * proposedAnswer = 4
     *
     * actualAnswer = 3
     *
     * Your proposed answer of 4 is incorrect. The correct answer is 3.
     *
     * End Of Example
     *
     * You do not need user input. You should be able to make a String of an equation and use that.
