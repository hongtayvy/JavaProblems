# Welcome to Sushiotle!
We are opening a new sushi place unlike any other sushi place. At this sushi place we
get to provide the customer with **"build your own"** sushi experience. What does
this entail?

## Project Structure
I have created the folder in which your project will live. You will decide the following
the project structure, classes, methods, and objects.

## Project Requirements
1. An individual should be able to order the following:
    - A single / multiple roll(s) or bowl(s) (must choose)
    - 0 to 2 types of protein (does not need to choose)
    - 0 to 10 types of fillings / toppings (does not need to choose)
    - 0 to 3 types of sauces / (does not need to choose)
2. Each item should have their own price
    - i.e. a single roll with 1 protein, 3 fillings, and 1 sauce could be different from a bowl with selected options.
3. Once you've created their order, you must calculate their total and print it out.
